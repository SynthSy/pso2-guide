							First, if you haven't done so already, download the <a href="http://arks-layer.com/docs/PSO2E5JP_SETUPEN.torrent">torrent</a> for the setup installation files.
							You will need a torrent client to download the torrent.
							Popular clients include <a href="https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download">Deluge</a>, <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php">qBittorrent</a>, and <a href="https://filehippo.com/download_utorrent/">µTorrent</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once you've installed a torrent client, you will then need to open the torrent inside of the torrent client itself.
							Usually double-clicking the torrent file will do this, but if it does not, then you could click on File, then selecting open in most
							torrent clients to do the same.

						<p>
							Now that you have downloaded and installed PSO2, this section of the guide
							will cover the various features of the PSO2 Tweaker as well as updating
							the game using the PSO2 Tweaker, provided by Arks-Layer.
						</p>
						<h3 id="tweaker-setup" data-toc-skip>Downloading the Tweaker</h3>
						<p>
							After PSO2 has been successfully installed, you will need to update the game by using the PSO2 Tweaker.
							Failure to do so will result in being unable to login and not being able to create your character.
						</p>
						<p>
							First, we'll need to ensure that the requirements for the PSO2 Tweaker are met. You will need to have the
							.NET Framework 4.6.2 or later installed. You can download the version 4.6.2 installer
							<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53344" target="_blank">here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have already ensured that you have .NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher installed, you can now continue
							with the download of the PSO2 Tweaker. Click <a href="http://arks-layer.com/" target="_blank">here</a> to
							visit the Arks-Layer page and download the PSO2 Tweaker. Be sure that you've chosen the "Setup file" option
							and not the "EXE only" option.

							<figcaption class="figure-caption">Download the Tweaker using this button!</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							Once installed, we will need to also set exceptions in our antivirus software. The reason for this
							is that most antivirus software use heuristics to identify possible unknown viruses, using certain
							patterns in behavior or how the program works. This means that the entire basis of how the Tweaker
							works gets it classified as a virus.
						</p>
						<p>
							You may wonder, what does the Tweaker do to get it classified as a virus? Well, let's look over in
							what the Tweaker does in the first place. The Tweaker is an alternative launcher for the Japanese
							online RPG Phantasy Star Online 2. It is used to download updates and offers more features with optional
							patches to enhance the user experience. The Tweaker contacts the Arks-Layer server to request these patches
							and downloads them into your game's folder.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Tweaker also allows you to download fan translation patches, which the Tweaker adds into the game itself.
							It's these things that virus heuristics wrongfully assume that the Tweaker is a virus.
						</p>
						<p>
							You will also need to set exceptions for the game itself. PSO2 utilizes an anti-cheat software known as
							GameGuard, which utilizes rootkit behavior to scan your running processes and files. You cannot disable or
							limit GameGuard's access in any way or form, as PSO2 will close if it detects this.

						<h3 id="tweaker-setup2" data-toc-skip>Launching the Tweaker & Updating the game</h3>
						<p>
							Now, after setting exceptions in our antivirus software, open the Tweaker as administrator.
							You'll be greeted with a pop-up message similar to below, asking if you would like to open a
							guide on how to use the tweaker.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/tweaker-1.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="Tweaker Opened">

							Click on "No" and you'll see another message asking if you have installed PSO2 already.
							If you've been following this guide, click on "Yes" and you'll be asked to search for the
							location to where you installed PSO2, for a folder named "pso2_bin".

							After searching for the location where you installed PSO2 and selected the pso2_bin folder,
							you'll be greeted with the main Tweaker window. It should then start the automatic file checking
							service in which the Tweaker will analyze your install and check which are out-of-date, then generate
							a list of files that it will need to download and update.

						</div>
						<p>
							Once it has finished file checking, it will then move on to the updater. The Tweaker will now
							download the files it needs to update your game. The speed of this is determined by your CPU speed.
