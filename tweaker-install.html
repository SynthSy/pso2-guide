						To use the Tweaker, you will need to have the .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later installed. You can download
						a copy from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53344" target="_blank">this link here</a>.
					</div>
					<h2 id="tweakersetupA" data-toc-skip>Tweaker Method</h2>
					<p>If you haven't done so already, grab the Tweaker installer from this page <a href="http://arks-layer.com/" target="_blank">located here</a> and
					install using the setup file.</p>

						<img src="images/choose-wisely.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="choose">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption">Download the Tweaker using this button!</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Once installed, we will need to also set exceptions in our antivirus software. The reason for this
						is that most antivirus software use heuristics to identify possible unknown viruses, using certain
						patterns in behavior or how the program works. This means that the entire basis of how the Tweaker
						works gets it classified as a virus.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Tweaker also allows you to download fan translation patches, which the Tweaker adds into the game itself.
						It's these things that virus heuristics wrongfully assume that the Tweaker is a virus. 
						More on the specific features later.
					</p>
					<h3 id="tweaker-setup2" data-toc-skip>Launching the Tweaker & Installing the game</h3>
					<p>
						Now, after setting exceptions in our antivirus software, open the Tweaker as administrator.
						You'll be greeted with a pop-up message similar to below, asking if you would like to open a
						guide on how to use the tweaker.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/tweaker-1.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="Tweaker Opened">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption">Clicking on "Yes" will open this guide.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Click on "No" and you'll see another message asking if you have installed PSO2 already.
						Click on the button labeled "No" and the install procress launches.
					</p>
					<p>
						A warning dialog pop-up will open, informing you where to install the game itself and that there is 
						<a href="torrent-install.html">another method to install the game</a>. Click on "Ok" to continue.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/tweaker-install-1a.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="where-to-install-warning">
					</figure>
					<p>
						Now select where to install the game. In this example, I chose a folder on my E:/ drive, but you can pick where
						you wish to have the game installed. If you would want to install to your C:/ drive, you can select the C:/ drive
						itself and the Tweaker will create a folder named <code>PHANTASYSTARONLINE2</code>, with the full folder path being
						<code class="highlighter-rouge">C:/PHANTASYSTARONLINE2/</code>.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/where-to-install.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="where-to-install-1">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption">Don't install on your desktop please!</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						You will then be asked to confirm your installation location. Click on "Cancel" to go back and reselect your desired
						install location. Click on "Ok" to confirm this location.
					</p>
					<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
						Note: Please ensure that you have 60 GB free of storage space on the disk PSO2 is installing into.
					</div>
					<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
						DO NOT INSTALL PSO2 IN YOUR DOCUMENTS FOLDER, THE DOWNLOADS FOLDER OR ON THE DESKTOP. WINDOWS 7 AND ABOVE
						RESTRICT PROGRAM PERMISSIONS IN THOSE LOCATIONS AND CAN CAUSE ISSUES WHEN ATTEMPTING TO START THE GAME.
					</div>
					<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
						THE DRIVE SELECTED MUST BE FORMATTED TO EITHER EXFAT OR NTFS. YOU CANNOT INSTALL THIS ON TO A DRIVE
						THAT IS FORMATTED TO FAT32, DUE TO FILE SIZE RESTRICTIONS.

					<figure>
						<img src="images/tweaker-install-2a.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="where-to-install-2">
					</figure>
					<p>
						Another pop-up will appear, telling you that the Tweaker will now begin downloading and creating the necessary
						files and folders it needs to install the game. Click on the "Ok" button to begin the download.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Now the main Tweaker window will appear and the install process will begin. During this time, the Tweaker may appear
						to be unresponsive, this is normal. Do not attempt to close or play the game until all of the files have been downloaded
						and installed. 
					</p>
					<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">	
						A pop-up may appear, informing you that it will restart the Tweaker and begin installing the game. 
						If you get this message, click on "OK" on this pop-up.

					<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
						Another pop-up may ask you if you would like to close another instance of the Tweaker. Do so to continue
						the installation process.

					<hr>
					<p>
						Now the VEDA Operating Terminal will launch and start the download process. Please sit back and do something
						else as your PC will divert its resources to the Tweaker's download process. Do not try to interrupt this process.
						The speed of this installer/updater depends on your CPU speed, download speed, and how much SEGA's download server
						allows you to download.
					</p>
					<p>
						The estimated time varies per person, but generally the download should finish around 6 to 8 hours.
						If it takes you longer than that to download, then you have hit the threshold in which SEGA has allowed
						you to download and will begin to throttle your connection. If this occurs, time may take longer than the
						usual hours. The time it takes to download the game during this may extend to a few days, in which we would
						recommend using <a href="torrent-install.html">the torrent method instead</a>, unless you decide to power through the download.

						By now, the Tweaker should be done downloading (or close to it, in that case, should be a few GB left) and a new pop-up
						will appear, telling you that the English Patch is missing. Click on "Yes" to install the English Patch. Click on "No" if
						you do not wish to play the game with translations enabled.
