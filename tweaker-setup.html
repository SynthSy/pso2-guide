						<h2 id="tweakersetupA" data-toc-skip>Tweaker Setup</h2>
						<p>
							Now that you have downloaded and installed PSO2, this section of the guide
							will cover the various features of the PSO2 Tweaker as well as updating
							the game using the PSO2 Tweaker, provided by Arks-Layer.
						</p>
						<h3 id="tweaker-setup" data-toc-skip>Downloading the Tweaker</h3>
						<p>
							After PSO2 has been successfully installed, you will need to update the game by using the PSO2 Tweaker.
							Failure to do so will result in being unable to login and not being able to create your character.
						</p>
						<p>
							First, we'll need to ensure that the requirements for the PSO2 Tweaker are met. You will need to have the
							.NET Framework 4.6.2 or later installed. You can download the version 4.6.2 installer
							<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53344" target="_blank">here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have already ensured that you have .NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher installed, you can now continue
							with the download of the PSO2 Tweaker. Click <a href="http://arks-layer.com/" target="_blank">here</a> to
							visit the Arks-Layer page and download the PSO2 Tweaker. Be sure that you've chosen the "Setup file" option
							and not the "EXE only" option.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/choose-wisely.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="choose">
							<figcaption class="figure-caption">Download the Tweaker using this button!</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							Once installed, we will need to also set exceptions in our antivirus software. The reason for this
							is that most antivirus software use heuristics to identify possible unknown viruses, using certain
							patterns in behavior or how the program works. This means that the entire basis of how the Tweaker
							works gets it classified as a virus.
						</p>
						<p>
							You may wonder, what does the Tweaker do to get it classified as a virus? Well, let's look over in
							what the Tweaker does in the first place. The Tweaker is an alternative launcher for the Japanese
							online RPG Phantasy Star Online 2. It is used to download updates and offers more features with optional
							patches to enhance the user experience. The Tweaker contacts the Arks-Layer server to request these patches
							and downloads them into your game's folder.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Tweaker also allows you to download fan translation patches, which the Tweaker adds into the game itself.
							It's these things that virus heuristics wrongfully assume that the Tweaker is a virus.
						</p>
						<p>
							You will also need to set exceptions for the game itself. PSO2 utilizes an anti-cheat software known as
							GameGuard, which utilizes rootkit behavior to scan your running processes and files. You cannot disable or
							limit GameGuard's access in any way or form, as PSO2 will close if it detects this.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 id="tweaker-setup2" data-toc-skip>Launching the Tweaker & Updating the game</h3>
						<p>
							Now, after setting exceptions in our antivirus software, open the Tweaker as administrator.
							You'll be greeted with a pop-up message similar to below, asking if you would like to open a
							guide on how to use the tweaker.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/tweaker-1.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="Tweaker Opened">
						</figure>
						<p>
							Click on "No" and you'll see another message asking if you have installed PSO2 already.
							If you've been following this guide, click on "Yes" and you'll be asked to search for the
							location to where you installed PSO2, for a folder named "pso2_bin".
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/tweaker-2.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="Tweaker Opened">
							<img src="images/tweaker-3.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="Tweaker Opened">
							<img src="images/tweaker-4.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="Tweaker Opened">
							<figcaption class="figure-caption">Locate where you've installed PSO2 and select the pso2_bin folder. Then press OK.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<div class="alert alert-default" role="alert">
							You may have a pop-up message informing you about fixing PSO2 permissions, just click OK and let it do its thing before continuing.
						</div>
						<p>
							After searching for the location where you installed PSO2 and selected the pso2_bin folder,
							you'll be greeted with the main Tweaker window. It should then start the automatic file checking
							service in which the Tweaker will analyze your install and check which are out-of-date, then generate
							a list of files that it will need to download and update.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/tweaker-5.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="Tweaker Opened">
							<figcaption class="figure-caption">The main PSO2 Tweaker window.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<div class="alert alert-default" role="alert">
							The speed of this check depends on how powerful your computer's CPU is. Generally latest generation hardware will breeze by it
							faster, while older generation hardware will be slow. 
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
							You cannot skip this check, and attempting to do so will cause your
							game's integrity to be unstable, thus you may encounter odd behavior in-game.
						</div>
						<p>
							Once it has finished file checking, it will then move on to the updater. The Tweaker will now
							download the files it needs to update your game. The speed of this is determined by your CPU speed.

							<figcaption class="figure-caption">The VEDA System Updater, the Tweaker's updater for PSO2.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							After you have successfully updated. The Tweaker will prompt you if you wish to install the English patch.
							Click yes to install it. If you click on no, but decide you want to install the English patch after all,
							you can click on the Gear Menu and click on "Install English Patch",
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/tweaker-english.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="Tweaker Opened">
						</figure>
						<p>
							Whether you have installed the English patch or not, you may now play the game as is by clicking on "Start PSO2".
							However, there are more features that the PSO2 Tweaker that you can enable and install. If you wish to configure
							your graphics settings, click <a href="#configgfx">here</a> to jump to the Graphics Configuration section of this guide.

						<h3 id="plugins" data-toc-skip>Tweaker Plugins & Features</h3>
						<p>
							The PSO2 Tweaker offers extra add-on plugins that enhance the overall gaming experience for PSO2.
							Things such as an Item Translator, or a built-in proxy for those who are affected by an IP block.
						</p>
						<p>
							To access these plugins, click on the button labeled "Plugin Settings" on the tweaker.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/plugin-button.jpg" class="img-resposive figure-img img-fluid" alt="Tweaker Opened">
							<figcaption class="figure-caption">Click this button!</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							You will now be greeted by the Plugin Menu. A checked box means that the selected plugin has been enabled
							and an unchecked box means the plugin is disabled.

						<p>
							By default, the Block Translation, Item Translation, and Title Translations plugins are enabled. If you have installed
							the English patch when prompted, the Text Translation plugin will also be enabled.

											Dubbed the "Raiser" plugin by Arks-Layer, this plugin allows the fan translation patch to function.
											Disabling this plugin will make the game be in its default language of Japanese.
										</td>
									</tr>
